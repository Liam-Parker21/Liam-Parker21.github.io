Shortly after graduation I moved to Ann Arbor to attend Washtenaw Community College where I took classes in Exercise Science, Psychology, and Economics. After my second semester I decided that I was done with school and began to take less and less classes. Closing out my first round of schooling, I ended with 44 credit hours. Since enlisting in the Army, I have obtained certifications in TacLan systems as well as Comptia's Security+. At this time I have been taking my own courses on DigitalUniversity and plan to begin traditional schooling here shortly."
